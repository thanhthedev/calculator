# Fancy App (TDD Practice)

Fork this repo and clone it.

Run the tests.

```ruby fancyapp_test.rb```

One test should pass, one should fail.

**Next steps:**

1. Fix the first failing test by implementing the minus method.
2. Make sure your code works by running the tests again.
3. Write the multiply _test_ (don't implement the multiply method yet).
4. Run the tests again. Your new test should fail.
5. Now you can implement the multiply method
6. Run the tests to make sure your code works.
7. Add + commit your changes.
8. Repeat steps 3 - 7 for the remaining unfinished tests.
